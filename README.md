# Repeater Observations
This repository will store observations of repeaters from Pleasanton and Livermore area.


Please fill free to download, check and modify. I will be thankful if you can let me know if there are mistakes in my notes or if you are reaching some other repeater than I did on a frequency.

If you email me your modified file, I will upload it here. Or, if you have a GitHub account, please submit a pull-request.

I am new with GitHub, so please bear with me while I figure this out.

Arguably, GitHub is not the best platform for this type of interaction, but hopefully, it will do till another alternative is found.
